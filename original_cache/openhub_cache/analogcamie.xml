      <description>Analog was created by Stephen Turner in 1995 as a multi-purpose, multi-platform log file analyser. He maintained the project until 2004, at which point he ceased to update the project. In 2007, as a long-term user of Analog and in light of the release of Windows Vista that could not be identified by Analog, C:Amie has undertaken to maintain Analog and to keep its detection current.</description>
